# liri-node-app

This project is inspired by Siri and Cortana. It accepts four different search commands from a user and outputs a result. It is useful because whereas google returns an overwhleming number of results for a search, LIRI returns only the specific answer. It is great for users who cannot speak for whatever reason, they lost their voice or are in a place where the noise must be kept to a minmimum. 
In order to use LIRI the user must type "node liri.js then one of the following commands followed by the search: 
concert-this 
spotify-this-song 
movie-this 
do-what-it-says
